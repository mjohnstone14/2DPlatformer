# Mr Bluesky, Created by Aidan White, Chris Tordi, Isabella Schwartz, Marwan Johnstone

A 2D platformer created as a group project for the 2017 Game Development and Programming course at DIS in 
Copenhagen, Dennmark. The game takes a large scope to platforming by allowing the player to make their own
platforms with the mouse. In addition, to defeat enemies you must draw your shield to block the enemies shots back at them. 
This was a great project to make and it was a first for us that we worked hard on and put in our own unique style to.
